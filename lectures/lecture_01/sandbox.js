// Lecture 1 - Getting familiar with the Document Object Model (DOM)

// The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
// It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, which can be
// manipulated using a programming language such as JavaScript.

// ---------------------------------------------------

// How get started with the DOM:

// 1. Open the browser console

// 2. Type the following code:
// document

// 3. Press Enter

// 4. You should see the following output:
// [object HTMLDocument]

// 5. This is the document object, which represents the web page in the browser.
// The document object has properties and methods that can be used to interact
// with the web page.

// 6. You can check that the document object is an actual object by typing the
// following code in the console:
//
// typeof document
//
// or
//
// typeof(document)

// 7. You may note that the document object is very similar to the elements that
// are displayed on the web page. This is because the document object is the root
// of the DOM tree, and all other elements are descendants of the document object.
